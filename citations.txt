Below the dashed line, include easily understandable and verifiable 
citations to all the major sources you used for your project, as described
in the TP document: 
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/notes/term-project-and-hack112.html#tp-policies

In addition, your code must also include citations directly in the code that 
make it clear where you use code that is partly or entirely not of your 
original design, and what the source is for that code.

was also used for to outline what I needed for the RL files 
(more specifically, i used it to figure out what steps to take to make a reinforcement learning algorithm in python
for a turn based game since I planned to use qlearning).

used for qlearning:
